Logic

There are 3 coins on the table: gold, silver, and bronze. If you make a true
statement, you will get one coin. If you make a false statement, you will
get nothing. What sentence can guarantee you getting the gold coin?

Answer.

You will not give me the bronze & the silver. If it is true > I will get gold, else > I also will get a gold (because minus multiply minus equal +)
